# KOOS-V1-FEAT-033: image upload, two directions, editable designs

**Ticket:** [KOOS-V1-FEAT-033](https://app.clickup.com/t/123qy9rtnj2) (urgent)
**Design references:** Figma `KO-OS-Upload-Picture---Edit-with-AI` node 14-1643; the ticket's HTML prototype (a front-end mock, every AI action faked locally).
**Decided with Oluwaseyi, 2026-10-21:**

1. **Editor:** a free-form layer editor, built in phases.
2. **Directions:** two different concepts, not one concept drawn twice.
3. **Edit with AI:** uses the app's existing model, `getModel("strategy")`.
4. **Old variants:** at the Calendar and Design Studio entry points, the two editable directions replace the 1-3 route variants. Model-drawn variants are no longer produced there.

## Why a new design model

Today one generation produces one `DesignSpec`, the short structured description of a design (`src/lib/design/spec.ts`). It is rendered by five fixed flexbox layouts (`render/layouts.tsx`) through satori. Elements have no positions, so nothing can be dragged, resized or rotated. On top of that, the background plate is never stored, so changing one word costs a new image-model call.

The fix is a **layer document**: an absolutely positioned list of elements.

- Generation builds it from the spec.
- The editor (phase 2) mutates it.
- One renderer draws it in both places:
  - **On the server:** satori turns it into PNG.
  - **In the browser:** the same JSX renders as DOM.

Satori renders a subset of HTML/CSS. Restricting the renderer to that subset makes the editor and the export agree by construction. A canvas library (Konva, Fabric) would need a second renderer and a parity test it could never fully pass. That is why the editor is DOM + `react-moveable` and not `react-konva`.

## Phases

| PR | Scope |
|---|---|
| **1 (this spec)** | Image choice (own image or KO imagery), upload with preview/remove/replace, two directions as layer documents with a "why this works" list, results screen, PNG and JPG download, regenerate. Calendar post and Design Studio entry points. |
| 2 | Editor: canvas select/drag/resize/rotate/snap, Design and Layers panels, undo/redo, versions (save, restore, up to 30), format switch. |
| 3 | Edit with AI: free-text and chips, scope (whole design or selection), proposal preview with changed elements outlined, brand checks, accept/decline/try again, accept saves a version. |

### `src/lib/design/document/schema.ts`: `designDocumentSchema` (zod), version 1

```
{
  version: 1,
  width, height,              // canvas px, from canvasFor(aspectRatio)
  background: string,         // CSS colour
  elements: Element[]         // array order is z-order, first is bottom
}
Element (shared):
  id, name, x, y, width, height, rotation (deg), opacity (0..1), hidden, locked
  type "image":  asset: AssetRef, fit "cover"|"contain", crop {zoom>=1, focusX 0..1, focusY 0..1}, radius
  type "shape":  fill (colour or linear-gradient), borderColor, borderWidth, radius
  type "text":   text, role "headline"|"subheadline"|"cta"|"footer"|"body",
                 font "heading"|"body", fontSize, fontWeight, lineHeight, letterSpacing,
                 align "left"|"center"|"right", italic, color
  type "button": label, fill, color, radius, fontSize, fontWeight
  type "logo":   asset: AssetRef, backing: colour|null
AssetRef = { key: string }    // an R2 storage key, never a URL
```

- **Keys, not URLs.** An asset is referenced by storage key. The server resolves keys to bytes for satori, and the client resolves them to signed URLs.
- **Pinned prefixes.** Keys are accepted only under `logos/`, `generated/` and the new `design-images/` prefix. This is the same pinning `storageKeyFrom` already enforces, so a document can never point the renderer at an arbitrary host.

### `src/lib/design/document/render.tsx`

`documentElement(doc, assets: Record<key, dataUri|url>, fonts) → ReactElement`.

- Only CSS satori supports: `position:absolute`, `display:flex`, `transform: rotate()`, `opacity`, `borderRadius`, `objectFit`, `backgroundImage: linear-gradient`.
- No browser-only properties.
- The same function runs in the editor.

`rasterizeDocument(doc, assets, brandFonts) → PNG bytes` reuses the composite rasterize path. That covers its brand-font fallback and its logo-backing measurement.

### `src/lib/design/document/from-spec.ts`

`documentFromSpec({ spec, palette, canvas, image: AssetRef|null, logo }) → DesignDocument`.

- **One builder per existing layout:** `hero-center`, `split-left`, `banner-bottom`, `quote-card` and `stat-highlight`.
- **Explicit geometry:** each builder computes boxes for the same zones the flex layout produces today, from canvas width and height.
- **Text that fits:** headline size is fitted to its box from the text length and the measured advance widths of the font in use. The fit check is a deterministic function with tests. It is not a guess.

### Generation (`src/lib/jobs/run-design-generation.ts`)

New request field `image: { source: "upload", key } | { source: "ko" }`. Its presence selects the directions path. Without it, generation keeps today's behaviour, so other callers are unchanged.

1. **Two specs from one model call.** One `generateObject` returns `{ directions: [DirectionSpec, DirectionSpec] }`. A `DirectionSpec` is a `DesignSpec` plus `rationale: string[]` (2 to 4 short reasons, shown as "why this works").
   - The two must differ in layout. Code enforces it: when the model repeats a layout, the second direction gets the first layout not used by the first direction and not in recent layout memory.
2. **Imagery.**
   - `upload`: the user's image is that direction's image element. No image-model call is made.
   - `ko`: one plate per direction from `getPlateAdapter()`, stored at `generated/{brandId}/plates/{uuid}.png` and referenced from the document, so later edits never pay for it again.
   - A failed plate still yields a design on a flat brand colour, as today.
3. Each direction runs through the existing pre-delivery gate (`renderGuarded` semantics: deterministic checks, one judge correction).
4. Each direction is one `design_generations` row, `renderer = composite`, holding the document and rationale. The job result lists both ids.
5. Quota: one generation is one quota unit, as today.

### Upload

- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/uploads/presign` with `kind: "design-image"`.
- **Allowed:** PNG, JPEG or WEBP, up to 20 MB, stored under `design-images/{brandId}/{uuid}.{ext}`.
- **Normalised in the browser:** before upload the browser re-encodes every image to fit within 2560 px on the long edge, keeping the type for PNG and JPEG and turning WEBP into JPEG.
  - **Why:** satori cannot draw WEBP (see `run-design-generation.ts` on "u2 is not iterable"), and phone photos arrive at 7000+ px, which resvg rasterises slowly and with a large memory cost inside a lambda.
  - **Free fixes:** re-encoding through `createImageBitmap` also applies EXIF orientation, and strips EXIF metadata such as location.
  - The server accepts only PNG and JPEG keys, and refuses files over 4096 px on either side (`readImageDimensions`).
- **Checking the real file:** at generation the server sniffs the bytes (`detectImageType`). If they are not PNG or JPEG, it fails with "This image can't be used" and the user is told to choose another.

### Schema (migration `0037_design_documents.sql`)

`design_generations` gets four new nullable columns: `document` (jsonb), `rationale` (jsonb), `image_source` (text: `upload` or `ko`) and `source_image_key` (text). Old rows keep `document = null` and render exactly as today.

### UI

- **Entry points:** the calendar item drawer's Generate design button, and the Design Studio generate action.
- **Flow:** both open the image-choice modal: "Use a specific image" or "Let KO create the imagery".
  - **Upload:** drop zone with click-to-browse, type and size validation, preview with Remove / Replace / Use this image.
  - **Progress:** a four-step progress modal driven by the job's real progress events, with an error state.
  - **Results:** two direction cards, each with the image, "why this works", Download PNG, Download JPG and Regenerate. Editing is phase 2, so the card has no Edit control yet. A placeholder for an unbuilt feature is a lie.
- **JPG:** converted in the browser from the stored PNG on a `canvas`, white-filled first because JPEG has no alpha.
- Every wait follows CLAUDE.md "Every wait gets an affordance".

### Measurable outcome

- **Events:**
  - `design_image_choice` with `{source}`
  - `design_directions_generated` with `{source, directions, quality_faults}`
  - `design_downloaded` with `{format}`
- **Funnel:** image choice → directions delivered → download.
- **Cost:** with `source = upload`, image-model calls per generation drop from 1-3 to 0, visible on the usage row's `renderers` metadata.

## Out of scope for PR 1

The editor, versions, Edit with AI, background removal, format switching after generation, and multi-page output (KOOS-AI-002).
